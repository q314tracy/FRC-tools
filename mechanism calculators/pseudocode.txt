calculating kA and kV

constants needed:
number of motors used to drive mechanism
maximum applied voltage
maximum free speed in RPM
stall torque at zero RPM
    torque is linear, zero at max RPM and full at zero RPM
ratio of mechanism
moment of inertia of the mechanism (if rotational)
    moment of inertia = mass * radius^2
    these can also be used to calculate more accurately
        I = 0.5 * m * r^2 cylinder model
        I = 0.0833 * m * (a^2 + b^2) rectangular plate model
    approxmiate radius of object is expressed by r in these equations
circumference of wheel driven (if linear)
weight of mechanism

resultant calculations:
maximum acheivable speed
    linear speed needs circumference of wheel that is driven for transformation
    linear speed per second = (RPM / final ratio) * conv factor / 60
maximum acheivable acceleration
    accleration = force in newtons / mass
    linear force = torque (at stall in this case) / wheel radius
calculated kV constant in units of volts per unit of velocity
    conversion factor = wheel diameter * pi / 60
    velocity = (free speed rpm / final ratio) * conversion factor
    kV = volts / velocity
        examples
            example with units of m/s
                conversion factor = (0.0762 * pi) / 60
                conversion factor = 0.00398
                velocity = (6784 / 4.71) * 0.23938
                velocity = 5.74365m/s
                kV = 12volts / 5.74365m/s
                kV = 2.09059 volts/(m/s)
            example with units of rad/s
                conversion factor = (2 * pi) / 60
                conversion factor = 0.10471
                velocity = (11000 / 46.42) * 0.10471
                kV = 12volts / 24.81279rad/s
                kV = 0.48362 volts/(rad/s)
calculated theoretical kA constant in units of volts per unit of accleration
    linear force = torque / radius
    moment of inertia = mass * radius^2
    accleration = force / mass (linear)
    accleration = torque / moment of inertia (angular)
    kA = voltage / acceleration
        examples
        note that this is calculated off of theroetical values and thus may need tweaking
        example with units of m/s^2 (linear)
            no moment of inertia calculation needed here since this is linear
            stall torque = 2.65Nm * 4.71 at zero (need to apply ratio since it multiplies torque)
            stall torque = 12.48150Nm
            wheel radius = 0.03814m
            mass = 65.77kg (145lb)
            force = (12.48150nm / 0.03814m) * 4 (multiply for 4 wheels)
            force = 1309.01940N (294.267 lbf!!!!)
            acceleration = 1309.01940 / 65.77kg
            acceleration = 19.90298m/s^2 (65.29849 ft/s!!!)
            stall torque is typically rated at full applied nom volts, so 12 volts is used here
            kA = 12volts / 19.90298m/s^2
            kA = 0.60292 volts/(m/s^2)
        example with units of rad/s^2 (angular)
            stall torque = 0.97 * 46.42 (also need to apply ratio to multiply torque)
            stall torque = 45.07240Nm
            mass = 2.26kg
            radius = 0.1016m
            moment of inertia = 0.5 * 2.26kg * 0.1016m^2
            moment of inertia = 0.01166kg/m
            acceleration = 45.07240Nm / 0.01166kg/m
            accleration = 3865.55746rad/s^2
            kA = 12volts / 3865.55746rad/s^2
            kA = 0.0031
            this result is ridiculously low due to low moment of inertia and extremely high torque
